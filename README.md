# TECH UNIVERSITY

This is CRUD application done in Rails 5.

Idea is that user can register and enroll in courses that are available on Tech University.

He can see some information about courses and edit his profile.

Things that I have covered:

* CRUD actions

* Authentication system

* Materialize CSS

* Many to many database relation 

This is the first version, so I will add some new features to this application.
